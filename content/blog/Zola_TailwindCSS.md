## Introduction
### Zola
If you need to create a no-fuss fast-loading blog quickly, check out [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). I've used a ton of [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators) frameworks in the past. Zola is relatively lesser well-known than some of the other generators you may have heard of.  But it's precisely the trimmed down feature set getting out of the way that gets you up and running super fast that is the real selling point.  Couple that with the fact that Zola is written in Rust and deployed as a single self-contained binary, which means high-speed generation times. For many projects, you won't need anything more. 
After [installation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/), the ["First Steps with Zola"](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/#first-steps-with-zola) instructions are clear and easy to follow to get a basic markdown-powered blog up and running.

### TailwindCSS
Once you have your site up and running, you'll want to style your pages.  You can follow Zola's instructions for [using Sass](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/sass/) if you're into hand-coding all of your CSS.  The benefit is that you won't have to install any other dependencies since Zola includes the Sass processor in its' self-contained binary.  Otherwise, check out [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  TailwindCSS is a rapid-development utility-first CSS framework for quickly assembling any design you would be able to build with vanilla CSS. Since TailwindCSS is not included in the Zola binary, you'll have to jump through a few simple hoops to get it running as part of your site development workflow.  Once you're set-up, however, you won't have to think about it anymore.

## Preparing your Zola site for TailwindCSS

### Installing TailwindCSS
If you followed the ["First Steps with Zola"](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/#first-steps-with-zola) instructions, you should have a project file structure similar to the following:
```fish

/
├─ themes/
├─ templates/
├─ static/
├─ sass/
├─ content/
├─ config.toml

```
In your project root directory, use yarn to install TailwindCSS and the Tailwind typography plugin, which will apply styles to your markdown output when the pages are generated.
```fish
yarn add tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/typography
```
Then run `npx tailwindcss init` to generate tailwind config and postcss config files in your project root.  You won't have to touch the postcss.config.js file.  Open tailwind.config.js and replace the contents with the following:
```js
// ./tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  purge: ["./templates/**/*.html", "./theme/**/*.html"],
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [
      require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
};

```
You won't need the sass folder, but you will need a styles folder, so go ahead and add a styles folder and remove the sass folder.
Create a styles.css file in your styles folder and add the following to it:
```CSS
/* ./styles/styles.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

```

### Configuring your Zola site
Run `yarn init` to create a package.json file in your project root directory, then open package.json and add the following:
```js
  "scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production npx tailwindcss -i styles/styles.css -o static/styles/styles.css",
    "watch": "npx tailwindcss -i styles/styles.css -o static/styles/styles.css; zola serve"
  },
```
Your file structure should now resemble the following:
```
/
├─ themes/
├─ templates/
├─ static/
├─ styles/
│  ├─ styles.css
├─ content/
├─ config.toml
├─ package.json
├─ postcss.config.js
├─ tailwind.config.js

```

Open your base.html file, in templates/base.html (assuming, again you followed the ["First Steps with Zola"](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/#first-steps-with-zola) instructions) and add the following to the HEAD section of your page:
```html
<!-- ./templates/base.html -->
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ get_url(path="styles/styles.css") | safe }}" />
...
</head>
```
This ensures your templates will use the stylesheet generated by TailwindCSS.  Finally, you'll want to open templates/blog-page.html. Then wrap the section that outputs the markdown with the following code. This code applies the prose tailwind class to automagically style your markdown content.  You'll be able to customize this at any time later:

```html
<div class=" mt-6 prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 mx-auto">
	{{ page.content | safe }}
</div>
		
```
### Running your site
At this point, you should be able to run `yarn watch` in your project root. The site will use the TailwindCSS CLI to generate your stylesheet, and then `zola serve` will generate your static site and display your local dev URL to view your site.

### Deployment
Have a read of the various [deployment instructions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/overview/).  Just remember that your production build service or script calls the Tailwind Cli first with:
```shell
NODE_ENV=production npx tailwindcss -i styles/styles.css -o static/styles/styles.css
```
followed by the following command which will build a production version of your site to the public folder.
```shell
zola build
```

##Conclusion
Super quick to set up with Zola, super quick to design with TailwindCSS, super quick to deploy on the static hosting platform of your choice.  Jamstack frameworks abound currently, but Ramstack tools like Zola with tiny learning curves make developing static sites fast and simple.
